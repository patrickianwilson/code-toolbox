# code-toolbox
This project is an attempt to provide quick setup scripts and frequently used code patterns for several prominent programming languages.  It uses the common 

```bash
bash -c $(curl https://someaddress/script.sh)
```

paradigm to actually setup an environment and setup the missing tools for that language

Currently, the following scripts are supported

```bash

bash -c $(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickianwilson/code-toolbox/master/setup-go-mac.sh)

bash -c $(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickianwilson/code-toolbox/master/setup-go-apt.sh)


```
